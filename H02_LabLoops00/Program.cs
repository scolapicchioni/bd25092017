             * 1) Print the numbers 1 to 10
            2) Change # 1 to print the numbers and add them as you go, printing the running total.
            3) Change #2 to print the sum of all at the end.
            4) Change #3 to not print the running total, just the list of numbers and the total
            5) Change #4 to multiply every number by 5 before adding it to the total
            6) Print the numbers 10 to 1 and then print the total of all these numbers.
            7) Print Hello World 5 times
            8) Repeat 5 times:  123 Hello World
            * Use a loop to print the 1,2,3
            9) Print: 
            123 Hello World
            123456 Hello World
            123456789 Hello World

            123456789101112131415 Hello World
            * Use one outer loop to print 5 lines and an inner loop to print the numbers
            10) Reverse the loop above, to print: 
            123456789101112131415 Hello World
            123456789101112 Hello World
            123456789 Hello World
            123456 Hello World
            123 Hello World
            * Use one outer loop to print 5 lines and an inner loop to print the numbers
            11) Change the inner loop above to print spaces instead of numbers:
                                    Hello World
                               Hello World
                          Hello World
                    Hello World
               Hello World
            * Use one outer loop to print 5 lines and an inner loop to print the numbers
            12) Interest Program 
            •	Write a program that calculates the interest that the Canarsie Indians would have accumulated if they had put the $24 that they had received for Manhattan Island in the bank at 5% interest. 
            •	Input - none; all the values are fixed 
            •	Output - Year and Principle 
            •	Other Information - 
            o	Principle is initially 24 
            o	Interest = Interest Rate * Principle 
            o	New Principle = Old Principle + Interest 
            13) Write a program that raises 2 to a power of 10 using a loop.
            14) Change the dice homework to throw the dice up to 20 throws or when the total is 9. Then, print the total number of throws at the end. 
            15) Change #14 to consider that a total of 9 before 20 throws is a win, and not reaching a 9 in 20 throws is a loss. The, play that game 5 times and calculate the wins and losses. Then, calculate the win percentage.
