Your program must then determine if the date is a “valid” date.  
Use the following information to determine if the date is valid:  January, March, May, July, August, October, and December all have 31 days.  April, June, September, and November all have 30 days.  February has 28 days in a non-leap year and 29 days in a leap year.  Echo the input and print either “valid date” or “invalid date” as output.
