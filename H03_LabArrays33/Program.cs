             * A player throws 2 dices, then the sum of the eyes are noted.
If the sum is 7 or 11 the player has won.
If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 the player has lost (the house has won).
If the sum in contrast is 4,5,6,8,9 or 10, you record the sum as the player's points.
The player then proceeds to throw the dice until the sum of the eyes is either the player points or until the sum is 7.
If the sum are the player's points then the player has won.
If the sum is 7, the player has lost and the house wins.
The program will operate in the way that the user must first enter how many games you want to play.
Then the program simulates desired number of games and finally prints how many times a player has won and how many times the house has won.
