             * Write a program which reads a year (integer) from the user and decides whether that year is a leap year. 
A year is a leap year (and so contains a February 29) if it is divisible by 4. 
But if the year is also divisible by 100 then it is not a leap year, unless it is divisible by 400.  
This means that years such as 1992, 1996 are leap years because they are divisible by 4 and are not affected by the rest of the rule which applies to century years such as 1900 and 2000. 
Century years are not leap years except where they are a multiple of 400. 
Hence, the years 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years and did not contain a February 29. 
But the year 2000 was a leap year, the first such century leap year since 1600.
